     "why": "C is often considered to be the mother of all languages because so many other languages have been based on it. Though C is simple it is one of the most powerful languages ever created.  Considering it was created over 40 years ago, it is still used heavily and is usually in the top 5 or 10 most popular and most widely programming languages in the world. Learning C can actually make you a better programming in other languages like C++, Java, or C# by equipping you with a mental model of what the computer is actually doing when you run your programs.",

     "difficulty": "intermediate",
     "why": "R is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Core Team and the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. Created by statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, R is used among data miners, bio-informaticians and statisticians for data analysis and developing statistical software. Users have created packages to augment the functions of the R language. According to user surveys and studies of scholarly literature databases, R is one of the most commonly used programming languages used in data mining. As of October 2022, R ranks 12th in the TIOBE index, a measure of programming language popularity, in which the language peaked in 8th place in August 2020.",

     "why": "Structured Query Language (SQL) is the way we communicate with a relational database. It's an intuitive and powerful language and mastering it is rapidly becoming a prerequisite for career paths outside of software development. SQL has been one of the most common skill sets required by employers for software developers for years, according to research published by Indeed. That fact is not likely to change any time soon, as businesses have woken up to the reality that the data they capture, generate, and store has tremendous business value to improve performance and efficiency and uncover new paths for growth.",

     "why": "Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub particularly for clientâ€“server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.",
